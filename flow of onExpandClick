The onExpandClick function is a key part of the tree structure in your application. It is responsible for handling the expansion of nodes in the tree view. Below is a detailed explanation of how onExpandClick works, its parameters, and the flow of related functions across the provided files.

1. Definition of onExpandClick
The onExpandClick function is defined in TreeStructure2.js:
onExpandClick = (rowData, index, treeLevel, ancestorData, filteredRackResults) => {
  const list = listToAccess[treeLevel];
  this.props.getDataForTree2(index, list, rowData, ancestorData, filteredRackResults);
};

Parameters
rowData: The data object for the current node being expanded. It contains information about the node, such as its ID, name, and other properties.
index: The index of the current node in the parent array. This helps identify the position of the node in the tree structure.
treeLevel: The level of the tree where the current node resides. For example:
Level 0: Sites
Level 1: Structures
Level 2: Floors
Level 3: Equipment Types
Level 4: Vendors
Level 5: Racks
ancestorData: An array containing the data of all ancestor nodes leading up to the current node. This provides context about the hierarchy of the current node.
filteredRackResults: An optional array of filtered rack results. This is used to pass additional data related to racks when expanding nodes.
What It Does
Determines the List to Access:

The listToAccess object maps the treeLevel to a specific list name (e.g., sitesList2, structuresList2, etc.).
Based on the treeLevel, it determines which list to fetch data for.
Dispatches an Action:

Calls the getDataForTree2 function (passed as a prop) to fetch data for the next level of the tree.
Passes the index, list, rowData, ancestorData, and filteredRackResults as arguments.
2. Flow of onExpandClick
Step 1: Triggered in TreeViewRowRightClick.js
The onExpandClick function is triggered when a node in the tree is expanded. This happens in the TreeViewRowRightClick component:
onExpandClick(rowData, index, parentLevel, ancestorData, path);

Here, the onExpandClick function is called with the following parameters:

rowData: The data for the current node.
index: The index of the current node.
parentLevel: The level of the current node in the tree.
ancestorData: The data of all ancestor nodes.
path: The derived path for the node.
Step 2: Passed to TreeStructure2.js
The onExpandClick function in TreeStructure2.js is invoked. It determines the list to access based on the treeLevel and dispatches the getDataForTree2 action.

Step 3: Dispatches getDataForTree2 Action
The getDataForTree2 function is defined in FloorPlanActions.js:
export const getDataForTree2 = (index, list, rowData, ancestorData, filteredRackResults) => ({
  type: types.GET_FLOORPLAN_TREE_DATA_SAGA_2,
  index,
  list,
  rowData,
  ancestorData,
  filteredRackResults,
});

This action creates an object with the following properties:

type: The action type (GET_FLOORPLAN_TREE_DATA_SAGA_2).
index: The index of the current node.
list: The list to fetch data for.
rowData: The data for the current node.
ancestorData: The data of all ancestor nodes.
filteredRackResults: Additional data related to racks.
Step 4: Handled in a Saga
The action is handled by a saga in FloorPlan.js. Specifically, the requestFloorplanTreeData2 saga processes the action:
function* requestFloorplanTreeData2(action) {
  try {
    const { index, list, rowData, ancestorData, filteredRackResults } = action;
    switch (list) {
      case 'sitesList2':
        // Fetch data for sites
        break;
      case 'structuresList2':
        // Fetch data for structures
        break;
      case 'floorsList2':
        // Fetch data for floors
        break;
      case 'eqpTypeList2':
        // Fetch data for equipment types
        break;
      case 'vendorList2':
        // Fetch data for vendors
        break;
      case 'racksList2':
        // Fetch data for racks
        break;
      default:
        break;
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error.message);
  }
}
